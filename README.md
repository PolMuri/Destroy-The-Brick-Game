# Destroy The Brick Game

This is a classic Brick Breaker game developed in JavaScript, utilizing the <canvas> element for rendering. The game is simple but engaging: destroy all the bricks by bouncing a ball off a paddle, avoiding missing the ball to keep the game going.

This application was built as a learning exercise to improve my skills. Expect unoptimized code!

## Features

-Brick destruction: Break bricks by hitting them with the ball.

-Different brick colors: Bricks are randomly assigned different colors for visual variety.

-Game over state: The game resets if the ball falls below the paddle.

-PC and Mobile support: Play using either a mouse or touch controls.

## How to Play

-On PC: Move the paddle left or right using your mouse. The ball bounces automatically, and your goal is to destroy all the bricks. If the ball falls below the paddle, the game resets.

-On Mobile: Touch and drag your finger on the screen to move the paddle. The paddle will follow the horizontal position of your finger. Just like on PC, avoid letting the ball fall below the paddle.

## Technologies Used

-HTML5 Canvas: For rendering the game elements (ball, paddle, bricks).

-JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity.

-CSS: For basic styling of the canvas.

## Installation and Setup

-Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/brick-breaker-game.git

-Open the project folder and double-click on index.html to run the game in your browser.

Future Improvements

Add levels with increasing difficulty.

Introduce power-ups (e.g., multi-ball, paddle size increase).

Add sound effects and background music.

Track and display a high score.
